create a node CLI script in /markonce called mark.js that allows me to use a simple schema.txt file with nested selector names that generates an index.html and styles.css file from that containing stubs for the markup and css using ids by default and if the selector appears more than once it uses classes, craft the first demo schema.txt, craft a brief README.md file that describes the project, keep the code as minimal as possible
